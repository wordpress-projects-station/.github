## Hello everybody
This space was created as a binder for several dedicated repos from the expansion and improvement of wordpress. Everything you see is legacy, unofficial material built for business purposes

---

- <b>How to:</b> Browse the projects and discover every detail of them. It's all free ;)
- <b>Licence:</b> All licenses are present within each repository. Obviously, we do not assume any direct or indirect responsibility for the material displayed.
- <b>Contribute:</b> No plans are currently open or ready to contribute ... however you can always send a message to a contributor.
